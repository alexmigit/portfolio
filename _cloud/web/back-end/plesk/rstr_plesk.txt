contemplate life, love and why plesk uninstalled itself

# grep Erased /var/log/yum.log | grep 'psa\|plesk'

# wget http://autoinstall.plesk.com/plesk-installer

# chmod +x plesk-installer

# ./plesk-installer

Switch to the directory with daily dumps:

# cd /var/lib/psa/dumps

Find the most recent dump that contains the 'psa' database:

# zgrep "Current Database:" mysql.daily* | grep psa

where mysql.daily.dump.0.gz is the most recent daily dump. Restore the 'psa' database from the most recent daily dump:

# zcat mysql.daily.dump.0.gz | sed -n '/-- Current Database: `psa`/,/-- Current Database:*/p' | MYSQL_PWD=`cat /etc/psa/.psa.shadow` mysql -uadmin

# ./plesk-installer
